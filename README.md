## **Project Overview**

This project uses the popular data visualization tool, Tableau, to create an interactive dashboard using the Superstore dataset. The dashboard provides insights into average sales, average profit, and average discount, as well as top-performing product categories and segments. Additionally, the dashboard includes a geographical map showcasing average profit per state in the US and a donut chart highlighting product categories and their total profit.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Tableau Public installed on your system.

**Dashboard Structure**
--------------------

The dashboard is divided into six sections, each showcasing a different aspect of the data:

1. **Average Sales, Profit, and Discount**
	* This section displays the average sales, average profit, and average discount for the Superstore dataset.

2. **Product Categories & segments by its  average sales & average profit **
	* This section shows the product categories invarious segments classifies by its average sales & average profit.

3. **Top 5 Product Categories and Segments by Average Sales**
	* This section showcases the top 5 product categories and their corresponding segments by average sales.
4. **Geographical Map: Average profit by State**
	* This section provides an interactive geographical map of the US, highlighting the average profit  per state.

5. **Categories  by  its total profit**
	* This section displays a donut chart showing the product categories in terms of total profit.

6. **Top 5 Product categories by total  sales**
    * This section displays a bar chart showing the product categories in terms of total  sales.



## **Visualizations and Insights**
------------------------------

The dashboard includes the following visualizations and insights:

1. **Average Sales, Profit, and Discount**: A combination chart showing average sales as $229.86, average profit as $28.66, and average discount as $0.16 provides a comprehensive view of the Superstore dataset.


2. **Top 5 Product Categories by Total Sales**: The bar chart highlights the top-performing product categories based on total sales, enabling users to identify trends and patterns.The most profermed  product is phones & chairs with a total sales of $330k and $328k respectively.


3. **Top 5 Product Categories and Segments by Average Sales**: The horizontal bar chart provides a visual representation of the top-performing product categories in various segments, allowing users to analyze correlations between categories and segments.There are three segments namely corporate,consumer & House office in which the product category copiers & machines have almost similar average sales rate in House office & corporate.


4. **Geographical Map: Average Profit by State**: The interactive map enables users to explore average profit rate by state, revealing geographic trends and correlations.The vemont is the state with most average profit rate of around $204.The least is Florida


5. **Categories by Total Profit**: The donut chart provides a visual representation of the top-performing product categories in terms of total profit, facilitating analysis and decision-making.There is only three categories in the dataset namely technology,furniture & Office supplies in which the most profitable category is technology & least is furniture in terms of total profit.


6. **All Product categories in terms of average sales & average profit** : The stacked bar chart shows all the product categories in terms of average sales & average profit. The tables are least profitable compared to other categories .The average sales & average profit is high for copiers which is the most profitable category.

## **Version History**
------------------
1. v1.0: Initial release of the dashboard, covering the Superstore dataset.

## **Conclusion**

In this project, I explored the SampleSuperstore dataset using Tableau  and extracted several valuable insights. The dataset provides a rich source of data for analyzing sales and customer behavior, and this project demonstrates how to load, explore,visualize and analyze the dataset using Tableau Public for creating interative Dashboard.
